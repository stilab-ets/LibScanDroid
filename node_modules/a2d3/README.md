# Build SVGs with D3 and Angular 2

Demo Site: https://wealthbar.github.io/a2d3/

A set of composable and extensible Angular 2 directives for building SVGs with
D3 declaritively. This library provides functionality for basic charts out of
the box, but it can be easily extended to support building declarative syntaxes
for just about any SVG generated by D3.

This project was based off of
[AngularD3](http://wealthbar.github.io/angular-d3) which is still maintained
for Angular 1.x projects. It is feature equivalent, but  is essentially a
complete API rewrite with new syntax that makes it more appropriate for Angular 2.

## Installing

```
npm install a2d3
```

## Project Goals

The goals of A2D3 are:

- Provide a simple declarative syntax for common D3 graphs and charts
- An extensible core allowing for almost anything possible D3 to be expressed
  with a custom directive. 
- Designed the "Angular Way (tm)" using similar style to extensibility and
  directive communication.
- 100% stylable via CSS, with some added D3 'sugar' like allowing the use of
  the built in color scales with pie charts or being able to bind to a color
  scale from data.
- The ability to create custom directives that can both extend existing chart
  layouts as well as create new ones.

## Current Directives

- d3-chart - Provides the top level directives meant to contain the rest of the
  chart declarations.
- d3-data - Provides a declarative way to load data into the current scope
  directly from a URL
- d3-axis - Defines an axis and provide it's range and location (top, left,
  bottom, right)
- d3-area - Define an area graph
- d3-line - Defines a line graph
- d3-bars - Defines a set of bars for a bar chart

The directives are used via attributes and you can declatively compose the SVG as an Angular
template like this.

```html
  <d3-data [src]="dataUrl" (data)="lineLoaded($event)" [accessor]="parseValues" [callback]="log"></d3-data>
  <d3-data [src]="pieDataUrl" (data)="pieLoaded($event)" [accessor]="parseValues" [callback]="log"></d3-data>

  <section id="graphs" class="well">
    <h1>Basic Graphs</h1>
    <p>Basic line, area and bar charts can be composed together in the same chart.</p>
    <div class="d3-chart">
      <svg d3-chart [data]="line" >
        <g [d3-margin]="{ top: 40, right: 60, bottom: 40, left: 60}">
          <g d3-line x="date" y="optimal" yscale="total"></g>
          <g d3-area x="date" y="total"></g>
          <g d3-bars x="date" y="savings"></g>
          <g d3-axis name="date" label="Date" [extent]="true" orientation="bottom" [ticks]="5" time-format="%Y-%m-%d"></g>
          <g d3-axis name="savings" label="Deposits" orientation="left" [ticks]="3"></g>
          <g d3-axis name="total" label="Savings" orientation="right"></g>
        </g>
        <text>Test</text>
        <defs>
          <linearGradient id="gradient" x1="0%" x2="100%" y1="0%" y2="100%">
            <stop *ngFor="let s of gradient" [attr.offset]="s.offset" [attr.stop-color]="s.color" [attr.stop-opacity]="s.opacity"></stop>
          </linearGradient>
        </defs>
      </svg>
    </div>
  </section>

```

Unlike AngularD3 for 1.x, the SVG is an ordinary SVG template and you can place
custom SVG code as you wish and you can use regular Angular 2.x binding and
template syntax if you want. The D3 attribute directives merely extend some of
the elements through D3 data binding and manipulation.

## Try it out

This project uses NPM and Webpack. To run it clone this repo and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Building

You can build a commonjs modularized release by running:

    npm run-script dist

You can also update the docs which will be saved in `/docs` by running:

    npm run-script docs

If you have any other ideas for me, or feel like contributing to help add any
of this missing functionality, I encourage you to submit a pull request.
